FLUTTER Technology Test Project

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

Here are some resources to help you start if you are new to Flutter:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter application examples](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook)

For help starting with Flutter development, please refer to the
[online documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/), which offers tutorials,
examples, mobile development guides, and a complete API reference.

## Quick Start Guide

To launch the project, please follow the steps below.

Prerequisites: Note that you must have Flutter and the Android SDK modules installed on your machine.

_Before continuing, why not take a quick tour of the project structure_

- Technologies:
  - BLoC (Business Logic Components)
  - SQFlite (SQLite databases for Flutter applications except Windows)
  - GoogleFonts (To configure the global font of the application in a One-Time system)
  - etc. (I'll let you discover more when cloning the repository)

Here are the steps to follow to launch the project

1. **Clone the repository locally**
   To clone the repository locally, run the following command after retrieving the repository URL:

```git
git clone https://github.com/JackJosue517/DacTest.git
```

2. **Download the project dependencies**
   Run the Dart command while connected to the internet.

```dart
dart pub get
```

3.  **Run the application**
    There you go, you are almost there. You just need to enter a command to get the test result:

```flutter
flutter run
```

## Personal Thoughts

### State of Mind

After finishing or running out of the time I set for myself, I was **speechless** at the enormity
of the work that still remained to be done.

### Feelings

I am exhausted, disjointed, and dizzy. Domestic chores await me
because I paused them to finish this small test within a set deadline
considering that I do not work on Saturdays (Religion: Judeo-Christian)

I also give myself a small self-gratification,
because even if I do not meet the criteria, I did my best.

### What exactly did I do?

1. _Create an application from scratch that explores the data of the API (RANDOM USER API)[https://randomuser.me/documentation#howto]_
2. _Set up a solid and robust mini CRUD system on the data while conforming to the specifications and design patterns of the technologies used._
3. _Create a minimalist homepage that follows the modern trend with a small personal touch: Custom cards._
4. _A mini-search bar that retrieves the first entry that meets the user's request._
5. _Not to forget, the essential part of an application, no matter its size: A settings system. I added developing features and an action to display the licenses on the application._

### What could I have done if the deadline was extended?

1. _The first feature I would jump on would be the SEARCH BAR. It's kind of like the second heart of the application after the homepage._
2. _Develop the settings system and add more features to have a standard model of settings systems that could include among others:_
   - User logout functionality
   - Help and contact functions and the possibility to suggest features
   - Customization of cards (square shape on a Grid and others instead of a unique view)
   - Enable or disable automatic synchronization with the RANDOMUSER API.
   - etc. (Let's follow the specifications)
3. _Add small utilities (company logo, application image, splash screens, etc.)_
4. etc.

### Final Word?

# Thank you for this test!!! I HAVE LEARNED A LOT FOR MY NEXT STEPS.
